                <p><em>Student trying to learn as much as possible</em></p>
                <p>I am a college student who is currently going for Graphic Design. I feel as though I am not learning enough in that so I have decided to move on and try to teach myself on the side. I am a rock climber, even though I haven't been doing much of that as of late. I also love to read. I try to always have a book I am currently reading. I have a wonderful boyfriend and two beautiful kitties.</p>
